\section{Running the Program: }

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Step 1: Enter target, that is a path and some file mask, for example:
         
        \verb$              $ Target: \verb$\Masm64\*.as?|*.inc$. 
        
	\hspace{1cm} where:\\
        \verb$              $ Target Path: \verb$\Masm64\     $  (end with backslash character ``\verb$\$'') \\
        \verb$              $ Target Mask: \verb$*.as?|*.inc  $  (can't be empty, at least a wildcard ``\verb$*$'') 
        
        \item Step 2: Enter strings to search. If no string is entered then all files that fit the mask are listed. If there are two strings, files listed match both.
        \item Step 3: For each string set modes to search:
	 \subitem case: sensitive, insensitive or ignore first char
	 \subitem word: partial word, full word, or full with underscore (usually a compose word) 
        \item Step 4:  If You want to exclude files fitting some mask, write that in ``excluded'' cell (for example \verb$*.exe|*.lib|*.dll|*.obj$)
        \item Step 5 : When entered two strings, is possible to restrict the search to some distance between them. Enter in cell ``maxDist'' the number of bytes.
        \item Step 6 : Adittionally, files to search can be limited by size writing megabyte size in cell ``maxMb''.
        \item Step 7 : Click ``Find'' button (or Return key in any edition cell).
        \item Step 8 : a running search can be stopped any moment clicking same button, wich now show ``Cancel'' text.
     \end{itemize}


\section{Values storage: }

	After first running the program will create an .ini file to store current target and search parameters.
	
	Buttons ``+'' and ``--'' allow to store or remove current target from an specific list also stored in same file. 


\section {More about file mask}

	Some general file masks can be used to search:
	
	\hspace{2cm}``*``  in all files, except ``.`` and ``..``
	
	\hspace{2cm}``*.`` in files without extension

	\hspace{2cm}``.*`` in only extension files 

	\hspace{2cm}``*.*`` in all files with name and extension
	
\section {Files matching definitions}
	
	Clicking with mouse or pressing Enter key will open selected file in result list. Because is a tool for programming, is expected that extensions of interest have associated an editor.
	
	Executable files will not open to prevent unwanted runnings. 
	
	In similar way *.bat, *.cmd and *.js files will not run. But in this cases they will open in an editor. By default /masm64/qeditor is that editor. But is possible to select a new path or editor. If default or stored editor fail, a dialog will ask a new path or editor. Later, editor could be changed in LookingFor.ini file.
